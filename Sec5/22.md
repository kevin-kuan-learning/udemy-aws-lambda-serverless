# 22.VPC

Most lambda functions are not launched in a VPC, thus resources withing are unaccessible

Make lambda function laumch in VPC by assigning security groups

   ========== VPC =============
    subnet    subnet   subnet

at least 1 subnet per region


```
provider:
    vpc:
        securityGroupIds:
            - 
        subnetIds:
            - 
            - 

functions:
    function_name:
        handler: py_file.py_func
        vpc:
            securityGroupIds:
                - 
            subnetIds:
                - 
                -
```

Goto AWS console -> VPC service -> Your VPCs, Subnets, Security Groups
Use defualt VPC, & subnet. Create security group and assign default VPC.

AWS console -> Lambda function -> FUNC_NAME => Configurations -> VPC & subnet set.

AWS console -> IAM -> Roles -> ROLE_NAME -> Permission:Policy -> New Policy name with VPC Access
